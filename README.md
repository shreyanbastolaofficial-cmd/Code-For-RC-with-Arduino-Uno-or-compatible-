This Arduino-based RC car is controlled via Bluetooth using an HC-05/HC-06 module and a smartphone. Two DC motors, driven by an L298N motor driver, provide movement, while a servo motor handles steering. Commands like F (forward), B (backward), S (stop), L (left), R (right), and numbers 0â€“9 (speed levels) are sent from a Bluetooth terminal app.
